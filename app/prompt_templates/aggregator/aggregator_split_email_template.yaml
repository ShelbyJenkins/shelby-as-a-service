      Create a numbered list of unique stories.
      Summarize each story with as much detail as possible. Consider journalistic details like "Who, What, When, Where, Why, How."
      Crucial: Do not include individual stories lacking detail! You MUST be able to write at least 4 sentences about a singular story.
      It's better to return an empty list than it is to summarize a stories with scant details.
