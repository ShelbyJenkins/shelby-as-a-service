account for a customer\n\nIf the customer that you specified in the request body already exists the newly created virtual account is added to this customers list of accounts\nIf the customer that you specified in the request body does not exist yet a new customer is created together with the virtual account and the virtual account is added to this customer\n\nYou can create a virtual account for any supported cryptocurrency fiat currency Tatum virtual currency or fungible tokens created within Tatum Once the currency/asset is set for a virtual account it cannot be changed\nVirtual account balance\nA virtual account has its own balance The balance can be logically presented by the account balance and available balance\n\nThe account balance accountBalance represents all assets on the account both available and blocked\nThe available balance availableBalance represents the account balance minus the blocked assets Use the available balance to determine how much a customer can send or withdraw from their virtual account\n\nCryptocurrency virtual accounts\nWhen you create a virtual account based on a cryptocurrency for example BTC or ETH you have to provide the extended public key xpub of the blockchain wallet that will be connected to this account\nNOTE Adding xpub to the virtual account does not connect any specific blockchain address to this account xpub is a generator of addresses not an address itself\nNot all blockchains provide xpub for wallets or Tatum may not support wallets on some blockchains In such cases use the wallet address or the account address instead\n\nALGO No xpub provided use address from the generated wallet instead\nBCH Obtain xpub from the generated wallet\nBNB No xpub provided use address from the generated wallet instead\nBSC Obtain xpub from the generated wallet instead\nBTC Obtain xpub from the generated wallet instead\nCELO Obtain xpub from the generated wallet\nDOGE Obtain xpub from the generated wallet\nEGLD No xpub provided use address from the generated blockchain address insteadBlockchain addresses on Elrond are generated based on the mnemonic of an Elrond wallet If you do not have an Elrond wallet create

the generated wallet\nXLM No xpub provided use address from the generated account instead\nXRP No xpub provided use address from the generated account instead\n\nConnect a virtual account to the blockchain\n\nIf the virtual account was created with the wallets xpub generate a new blockchain address for this account\nIf the virtual account was created with the wallets or accounts address instead of the wallets xpub assign an existing blockchain address to this account\n\nYou can connect multiple blockchain addresses to one virtual
