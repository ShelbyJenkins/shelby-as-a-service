contract for NFT auction logic Smart contract enables auction operator to create new auction for NFT ERC721/1155\nOperator can set a fee in percentage which will be paid on top of the price of the asset\ncan be offered for native asset  ETH BSC etc  or any ERC20 token  this is configurable during auction creation\nBefore auction is created seller must approve transfer of the NFT to the auction contract\nBuyer will bid for the asset from the auction using native asset  send assets along the gid smart contract call or via ERC20 token\nBuyer of the auction must perform approval for the smart contract to access ERC20 token before the actual bid method is called\nOnce there is higher bid then the actual one the previous bidders funds will be returned to him and new bidder will be the current winning one\nWhen auction ends anyone can settle the auction  NFT will be sent to the bidder assets to the seller and fee to the operator\nThis operation deploys a smart contract on the blockchain\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\n\nSigning a transaction\nWhen creating an NFT auction you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nGenerateAuction\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ndescription Blockchain to work with\ntype
