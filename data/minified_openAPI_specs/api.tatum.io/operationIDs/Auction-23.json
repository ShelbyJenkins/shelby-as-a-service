call\nBid for an asset listed on the NFT auction\nYou can buy the asset either for the native blockchain assets for example ETH BSC and so on or for the fungible tokens of the blockchain\n\nIf you want to pay for the asset with the native assets send the required amount of the assets with the API call\nIf you want to pay with the fungible tokens allow the auction smart contract to access your tokens before bidding for the asset When you make the API call the auction smart contract will deduct the required amount of the tokens from the smart contract where you hold the tokens\n\nAfter you have purchased the asset it is in a pending state until the auction is settled Settling the auction means that the asset is transferred to the buyer the amount is transferred to the seller and the fee is transferred to the fee recipient of the auction\nFor the complete information about how the bidding/purchase process at an auction works see the API for creating an NFT auction\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\n\nThe execution reverted message\nWhen making this API call you may get the following message\nAlthough one or more Error Occurred execution reverted Contract Execution Completed\nThis message is a result of the auction version check and has no impact on completing the API call You can safely ignore it\nSigning a transaction\nWhen bidding for an asset at the NFT auction you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nBidOnAuction\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ndescription Blockchain to work with\ntype string\ncontractAddress\nmaxLength 42\nminLength 42\ndescription Address of the
