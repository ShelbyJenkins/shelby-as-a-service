account\ndescription 10 credits per API call\nFirst step to create new TRC 10/20 token with given supply on the Tron blockchain with support of Tatums private ledger\nThis method only creates Tatum Private ledger virtual currency with predefined parameters It will not generate any blockchain smart contract\nThe whole supply of TRC 10/20 token is stored in the customers newly created account Then it is possible to create new Tatum accounts with TRC 10/20 token name as accounts currency\nNewly created account is frozen until the specific TRC 10/20 smart contract address is linked with the Tatum virtual currency representing the token\nOrder of the steps to create TRC 10/20 smart contract with Tatum private ledger support\n\nCreate TRC 10/20 token this API  creates a virtual currency within Tatum\nDeploy TRC 10 or TRC 20 smart contract  create new TRC 10/20 smart contract on the blockchain\nStore TRC 10/20 smart contract address  link newly created TRC 10/20 smart contract address with Tatum virtual currency  this operation enables frozen account and enables ledger synchronization for TRC 10/20 Tatum accounts\n\nBlockchain address will be assigned to the virtual account as a deposit address It can be defined via the address explicitly or by using xpub and derivationIndex\nThere is a helper method Deploy TRC 10/20 Smart Contract to Blockchain and Ledger which wraps first 2 steps
