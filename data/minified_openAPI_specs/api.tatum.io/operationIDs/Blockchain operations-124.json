TRC10 or TRC20 smart contract to the blockchain and a virtual account\ndescription 10 credits per API call\nDeploy a TRON TRC10 or TRC20 smart contract This is a helper method which is combination of\nRegister new TRC10/20 token in the ledger and Deploy blockchain TRC20 or Deploy blockchain TRC10\nAfter deploying a contract to blockchain the contract address will become available and must be stored within Tatum Otherwise it will not be possible to interact with it and starts automatic blockchain synchronization\nSigning a transaction\nWhen deploying a TRON TRC10 or TRC20 smart contract to the blockchain and a virtual account you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript
