data and the type of the blockchain\nStore data on the blockchain\nThe total cost of a transaction on Ethereum in credits depends on the size of the data The data is stored as a string in the hexadecimal format and the maximum size of the data is approximately 130 kB on the mainnet and 30 kB on testnet Every 5 characters cost 1 credit\nTherefore one API call with 1 kB of data 1024
