ethereumsepolia\ntype string\nsummary Mint fungible tokens\ndescription 2 credits per API call\nCreate new fungible tokens in the smart contract the contractAddress parameter in the request body and transfer them to the specified blockchain address the to parameter in the request body You can mint new fungible tokens only if the current supply of tokens in the smart contract is lower than the total supply set for this contract\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nKuCoin Community Chain\nPolygon\nXinFin\n\nSigning a transaction\nWhen minting fungible tokens you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nChainMintErc20\ntype
