ethereumsepolia\ntype string\nsummary Allow a blockchain address to transfer and burn fungible tokens\ndescription 2 credits per API call\nAllow a blockchain address the spender parameter in the request body to transfer and burn fungible tokens on behalf of the smart contract owner\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\n\nSigning a transaction\nWhen allowing a blockchain address to transfer and burn fungible tokens you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nApproveErc20\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ntype string\ndescription The blockchain to work
