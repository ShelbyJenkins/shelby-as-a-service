smart contract the contractAddress parameter in the request body to the specified blockchain address the to parameter in the request body\nTransferring fungible tokens invokes the transfer method\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nAlgorand\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nKuCoin Community Chain\nPolygon\nSolana\nXinFin\n\nTransferring fungible tokens on Algorand\nOn Algorand the recipient has to agree in advance to receive your fungible tokens because Algorand charges users for storing the tokens on their addresses and an Algorand blockchain address by default does not receive the tokens unless explicitly agreed Before transferring the fungible tokens make sure that the recipient has agreed to receive the NFT to their address\nBlockchainspecific APIs to transfer fungible tokens\nYou can also use blockchainspecific APIs for transferring fungible tokens on the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKuCoin Community Chain\nPolygon\nXinFin\n\nSigning a transaction\nWhen transferring fungible tokens you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nChainTransferEthErc20\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ntype string\ndescription The blockchain to work with\nto\nmaxLength 50\nminLength 1\ndescription
