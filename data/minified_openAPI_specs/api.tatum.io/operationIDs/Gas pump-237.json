API call\nActivate the precalulated gas pump addresses Activating a gas pump address allows this address to send funds to other addresses\nYou can activate up to 270 addresses in one call If you need to activate more than 270 addresses make several API calls For example if you need to activate 500 addresses make an API call with 270 addresses set up the range of their index values accordingly in the from and to request body parameters and then make another API call with the remaining 230 addresses\nWhen to activate a gas pump address\nBecause activating a gas pump address costs some amount of gas on a blockchain you want to activate only those addresses that will be used for sending funds to other addresses If you know that a gas pump address will not be used for sending funds you can leave this address not activated The customer who uses this address will still be able to receive funds\nDepending on your business needs and requirements you can choose when to activate the gas pump addresses If you know for sure that all the precalculated addresses will be sending funds you can activate all the addresses right after they have been precalculated\nAlternatively you can set up the activation in such a way so that a gas pump address gets activated only when a specific event is triggered For example you can activate a gas pump address\n\nWhen it receives an asset for the first time\nWhen the customer tries to send an asset from this address for the first time\n\nAfter you make an API call to activate gas pump addresses use the API for getting the results of the address activation transaction\nPaying the gas fee for activating gas pump addresses\nYou can pay the gas fees for each activation transaction yourself or Tatum can cover it for you\n\nWhen paying the gas fees yourself you must sign the transaction with either the private key of the blockchain address from which you want to pay the fees or the signature ID of that private key if you use Key Management System KMS\nTo pay the fees yourself use this API with any schema of the request body except for ActivateGasPumpTatum For example if you are activating gas pump addresses on Ethereum and you use KMS use the ActivateGasPumpKMS schema\n\nIf you want Tatum to cover the fees use this API with the ActivateGasPumpTatum schema of the request body\n\nOn the mainnet you have to have a paid pricing plan\nTatum pays the fees from its own blockchain address Then the fee amount paid by Tatum is converted to the number of credits and these credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance of your paid pricing plan The transaction fees and the corresponding numbers of credits deducted from your allowance vary depending on what blockchain you activate the addresses\nOn the testnet no credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance You can activate gas pump addresses regardless of your pricing plan\n\n\n\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart
