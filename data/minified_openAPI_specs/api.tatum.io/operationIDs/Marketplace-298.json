marketplace\ndescription 2 credits per API call\nDeploy an NFT marketplace smart contract on the blockchain With a deployed marketplace smart contract you and your customers can create new  listings for assets such as nonfungible tokens and combinations of token types as described by the ERC721 and ERC1155 standards on the Ethereum blockchain or by the equivalent standards on the other blockchains As the marketplace operator you can set a fee as a percentage of the asset price that will be paid on top of the asset price\nThe purchase process looks like the following\n\nThe seller creates a listing for an asset on the NFT marketplace The listing can be offered for the native blockchain assets for example ETH BSC and so on or for the fungible tokens of the blockchain\nThe seller allows the marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset that they are selling\nA buyer buys the asset\nIf the buyer wants to pay with the native blockchain assets they make the purchase the buyAssetFromListing method is called against the marketplace smart contract and send the required amount of the native assets to the marketplace smart contract\nIf the buyer wants to pay with the fungible tokens\nThe buyer allows the marketplace smart contract to access their tokens and makes the purchase the buyAssetFromListing method is called against the marketplace smart contract\nThe marketplace smart contract deducts the required amount of tokens from the smart contract where the buyer holds the tokens\nThe marketplace smart contract transfers the asset to the buyer transfers the asset price to the seller and sends the fee to the marketplace fee recipient\n\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\nSolana in alpha\n\nSigning a transaction\nWhen deploying an NFT marketplace smart contract you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nGenerateMarketplace\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ndescription Blockchain to work with\ntype string\nfeeRecipient\nmaxLength 42\nminLength 42\ndescription Address of the
