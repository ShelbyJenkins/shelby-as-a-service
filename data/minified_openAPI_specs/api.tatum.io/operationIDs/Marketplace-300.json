marketplace\ndescription 2 credits per API call\nBuy an asset listed on the NFT marketplace\nYou can buy the asset either for the native blockchain currency for example ETH MATIC and so on or for the fungible tokens of the blockchain\n\nIf you want to pay for the asset with the native blockchain currency send the required amount plus the marketplace fee right in the API call in the amount request body parameter\nIf you want to pay with the fungible tokens allow the marketplace smart contract to access your tokens before making the purchase When you make the API call the marketplace smart contract will deduct the required amount of the tokens from the smart contract where you hold the tokens\n\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\nSolana in alpha\n\nThe execution reverted message\nWhen making this API call you may get the following message\nAlthough one or more Error Occurred execution reverted Contract Execution Completed\nThis message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing the API call You can safely ignore it\nSigning a transaction\nWhen buying an asset on the NFT marketplace you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nBuyAssetOnMarketplace\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ndescription The blockchain to work with\ntype string\ncontractAddress\nmaxLength 42\nminLength 42\ndescription The
