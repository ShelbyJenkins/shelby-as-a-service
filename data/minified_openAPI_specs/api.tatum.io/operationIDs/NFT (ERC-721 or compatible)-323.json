blockchain In a deployed NFT smart contract you can mint NFTs one NFT at a time or multiple NFTs at once burn and transfer NFTs\nSmart contracts are standardized and audited You can review the code of a deployed NFT smart contract here if the contract is deployed on Flow or here if the contract is deployed on any other supported blockchain\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nFlow\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nKuCoin Community Chain\nPolygon\nTRON\n\nGeneral NFT smart contracts\nBy default an NFT smart contract is deployed as a general NFT smart contract compatible with OpenSea royalties This is a standard NFT contract with AccessControl and Ownable enhanced with NFT batch minting NFTs minted on this smart contract are compatible with OpenSea and its royalty structure\nYou can enable public minting for smart contracts By default public minting is disabled which means that only the blockchain address whose private key was used to create the smart contract or the blockchain addresses added to the smart contract as NFT minters will be able to mint NFTs for the contract To enable public minting and allow anyone to mint NFTs on top of the smart contract deploy the contract with the publicMint parameter set to true in the request body\nNFT smart contracts and NFT Express\nIf you want to use NFT Express to mint NFTs on the deployed smart contract deploy the smart contract as a general NFT smart contract\nAfter you have deployed the NFT smart contract add the Tatum minter address as an NFT minter to your smart contract\nFor the complete information about using NFT Express on your smart contract see Use your own smart contract to mint NFTs in Mint an NFT\nSigning a transaction\nWhen deploying an NFT smart contract you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nDeployNft\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ntype string\ndescription The blockchain to
