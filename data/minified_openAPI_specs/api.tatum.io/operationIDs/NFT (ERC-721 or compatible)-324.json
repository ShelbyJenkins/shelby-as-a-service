request body to mint NFTs on your NFT smart contract the contractAddress parameter in the request body\nNOTE Use this API only when you are using NFT Express with your own smart contract For more information see Use your own smart contract to mint NFTs in Mint an NFT\nDo not use this API in any other case\nThis API is supported for the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nKuCoin Community Chain\nPolygon\n\nSigning a transaction\nWhen allowing a blockchain address to mint NFTs you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nrequestBody\noneOf\nAddNftMinter\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ntype string\ndescription The blockchain to work
