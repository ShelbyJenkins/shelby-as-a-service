Express\nNatively on a blockchain\n\nMinting NFTs using NFT Express\nNFT Express is Tatums feature that helps you mint NFTs easier than minting natively on a blockchain\n\nYou do not need to enter your private key or signature IDNFT Express uses the private key provided by Tatum\nYou do not need to hold crypto or keep addresses topped up with crypto to pay for minting transactions\n\nTo use NFT Express on the mainnet you have to have a paid pricing planTatum covers your transaction fees for NFT minting and pays for them from its own blockchain address Then the fee amount paid by Tatum is converted to the number of credits and these credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance of your paid pricing planThe transaction fees and the corresponding numbers of credits deducted from your allowance vary depending on what blockchain you mint NFTs on\nOn the testnet no credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance You can mint NFTs with NFT Express regardless of your pricing plan\n\n\n\nWith NFT Express you can choose whether to mint NFTs on the prebuilt NFT smart contract provided by Tatum or on your own smart contract\nUse the prebuilt smart contract provided by Tatum to mint NFTs\nIf you want to mint NFTs using the prebuilt smart contract you do not need to deploy your own NFT smart contract You do not need to provide the address of the NFT smart contract and the token ID in the request body either The address of the smart contract and the token ID are provided automatically by TatumThe token ID is autogenerated It starts with 0 and is increased by 1 for each new NFT The token ID is calculated separately for each supported blockchain and its mainnet and testnet\nFor more information see our user documentation\nYou can mint NFTs on the prebuilt smart contract provided by Tatum on the following blockchains\n\nAlgorand\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\nSolana\n\nDepending on what blockchain you use choose the request body schema to use in the API call\n\nTo mint NFTs on BNB Smart Chain Celo Ethereum Harmony Klaytn or Polygon use this API with the MintNftExpress schema of the request body\nTo mint NFTs on Algorand use this API with the MintNftExpressAlgorand schema of the request bodyTo be able to burn the minted NFTs any time later specify the address of the manager account in the manager parameterAn NFT minted on Algorand is automatically transferred to your blockchain address After the NFT is minted you have to transfer it to the recipients address The recipient has to agree in advance to receive your NFT because Algorand charges users for storing NFTs on their addresses and an Algorand blockchain address by default does not receive NFTs unless explicitly agreedThis how it works\n\nThe recipient agrees to receive the NFT to their address\nYou transfer the NFT to the recipients address use the transferNftAlgoExpress schema of the request bodyNOTE On the mainnet Tatum covers your transaction fees for the NFT transfer and pays for them from its own blockchain address Then the fee amount paid by Tatum is converted to the number of credits and these credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance of your paid pricing plan On the testnet no credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance\n\nTo mint NFTs on Solana use this API with the MintNftExpressSolana schema of the request bodySolana uses the Metaplex Protocol a smart contract and metadata standard for creating and working with NFTs When you mint an NFT on Solana with NFT Express the prebuilt smart contract based on the Metaplex Protocol is usedWhen an NFT is minted on Solana a new blockchain address is created to receive the NFT under the recipients account address the one in the to parameter of the request body This address is returned in the nftAccountAddress parameter in the response body is owned by the recipients address and has the same private keyThe response body also returns the address of the minted NFT itself which is held in the nftAddress parameter\nUse your own smart contract to mint NFTs\nIf you want to mint NFTs using your own smart contract you are going to use an NTF minter a special blockchain address provided by Tatum that will cover the minting fees The number of credits equivalent to the fees will be then deducted from the monthly credit allowance of your paid pricing plan\nFor more information see our user documentation and the article in the Tatum blog\nYou can mint NFTs on your own smart contract on the following blockchains\n\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nPolygon\n\nTo mint NFTs using your own smart contract do the following\n\nIn the table located under this section find the blockchain address of the Tatum NFT minter for your blockchain and network mainnet or testnet\nAdd the minter address as an NFT minter to your smart contract\nUse this API with the MintNftMinter schema of the request bodyIn the request body enter the following information\n\nchain is the blockchain that you use\nto is the blockchain address where to send the minted NFT to\nurl is the URL of the NFT metadata\nminter is the address of

the testnet does not have sufficient funds to cover the transaction fee add some amount to it using a crypto faucet of the blockchain\nTo be able to use NFT Express on the mainnet you have to have a paid pricing planFor Ethereum specifically we recommend an Enterprise Plan because transaction fees on Ethereum are very high\nMinting NFTs natively on a blockchain\nWhen minting an NFT natively on a blockchain you are using your own smart contract You are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nProviding the private key in the API is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed Your private keys should never leave your security perimeter You should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nFor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the Tatum Key Management System KMS and provide the signature ID instead of the private key in the API Alternatively you can use the Tatum JavaScript client\nYou can mint NFTs natively on the following blockchains\n\nAlgorand\nBNB Smart Chain\nCelo\nEthereum\nFlow\nHarmony\nKlaytn\nKuCoin Community Chain\nPolygon\nSolana\nTRON\n        \nDepending on what blockchain you use choose the request body
