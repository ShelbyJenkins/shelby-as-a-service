that you specified in the request body already exists the newly created virtual account is added to this customers list of accounts\nif the customer that you specified in the request body does not exist yet a new customer is created together with the virtual account and the virtual account is added to this customer\n\nyou can create a virtual account for any supported cryptocurrency fiat currency tatum virtual currency or fungible tokens created within tatum once the currency/asset is set for a virtual account it cannot be changed\nvirtual account balance\na virtual account has its own balance the balance can be logically presented by the account balance and available balance\n\nthe account balance accountbalance represents all assets on the account both available and blocked\nthe available balance availablebalance represents the account balance minus the blocked assets use the available balance to determine how much a customer can send or withdraw from their virtual account\n\ncryptocurrency virtual accounts\nwhen you create a virtual account based on a cryptocurrency for example btc or eth you have to provide the extended public key xpub of the blockchain wallet that will be connected to this account\nnote adding xpub to the virtual account does not connect any specific blockchain address to this account xpub is a generator of addresses not an address itself\nnot all blockchains provide xpub for wallets or tatum may not support wallets on some blockchains in such cases use the wallet address or the account address instead\n\nalgo no xpub

    "tag_summary": "a tatum account is the primary building block of tatumpowered applications it is an envelope that holds essential information about balances the state of the account or customer and to whom the account belongs\naccounts in tatum are stored within tatum private ledger tatum private ledger contains information about accounts the customers that own the accounts transactions that affect the accounts or virtual currencies present in the ledger\nby default the private ledger is not connected to any blockchain it is possible to create an application on it without any blockchain at all using tatum private ledger and the building blocks included within it it is possible to quickly swap the whole application from the ledger to any blockchain supported by tatum all of the api calls will remain the same the only thing that changes is the blockchain the application lives on\nmost blockchains do not have any compliance layer at all it is not possible to freeze funds at a blockchain address or deactivate an address the tatum account has builtin compliance and it is possible to block funds in the account freeze outgoing transactions from the account or even completely deactivate the account",
