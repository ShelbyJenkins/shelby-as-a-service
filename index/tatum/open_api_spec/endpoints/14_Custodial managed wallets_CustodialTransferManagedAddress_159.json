charged for each gas covered operation\nsign transaction and transfer assets from a custodial managed address\nsupported chains\n\nsolana\n\n\nlogic for solana\nin solana its possible to cover the fees connected to any arbitrary transaction by a third party\ntatum can cover these fees for any transaction on the solana blockchain  transfer of sol spl tokens minting or transferring nfts or invoking programs\nin order to do this tatum fee address must be used as a feepayer address during transaction creation\n\nmainnet addressdevnet

which is then passed to the api and signed\ntransaction could require multiple private keys for signing  fee payer sender of the sol assets minting key during nft mint operation etc\nsome of the keys are used in tatum  fee payer or in case of managed wallet holding sol assets the key of that managed wallet  those must be referenced in a list of walletids to be used\nfor external keys which are not managed by tatum those could either sign the transaction before its serialization or could be passed to the api in its raw form  this is ok only for keys which could be exposed and there is no harm of loosing assets on them\nhow to partially sign the transaction could be found here\nfee payer key is used by default doesnt have to be mentioned in the list of wallets used for signing\nexamples of
