the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api
