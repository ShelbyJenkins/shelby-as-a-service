call\nallow another blockchain address the spender parameter in the request body to transfer the asset from a gas pump address on behalf of the master address\nuse this api when the customer using the gas pump address sells assets on a marketplace or auction after the customer creates a listing of the asset they have to allow the marketplace/auction smart contract to transfer the asset to the buyer after the asset has been bought\nthe asset can be one of the following types\n\nfungible token erc20 or equivalent\nnft erc721 or equivalent\nmulti token erc1155 or equivalent\n\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nharmony\nklaytn\npolygon\nxinfin\n\nsigning a transaction\nwhen approving the transfer of an asset you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nrequestbody\noneof\napprovetransfercustodialwallet\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ndescription the blockchain to work with\ntype

    "tag_summary": "the gas pump is tatums feature that helps you manage gas fees in a custodial application when you use the gas pump gas fees for any transaction made by your customers users of your custodial application are automatically deducted from the master address instead of the customers address this eliminates the need to send crypto to each customers address to pay for gas fees\nfor more information about the gas pump see our user documentation\neach api related to the gas pump supports its own set of the blockchains the list of the supported blockchains is provided in the api description further in this section",
