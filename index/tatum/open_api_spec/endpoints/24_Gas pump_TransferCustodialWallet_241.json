asset from a gas pump address to the other address\nthis operation is usually performed by users in your custodial application a user who has a gas pump address assigned wants to transfer an asset to some address on the blockchain\nthe gas fee for sending the asset will be covered by crypto funds on the master address make sure that the master address always has enough funds to cover gas fees\nto be able to send the asset\n\nthe gas pump address must be activatedto check whether the gas pump address is activated use this api\nthe gas pump address must be the owner of the asset\n\nwith this api you can send only one asset per api call if you want to send multiple assets use the api for transferring multiple assets from a gas pump account\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nharmony\nklaytn\npolygon\ntron\nxinfin\n\nsigning a transaction\nwhen transferring an asset you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nrequestbody\noneof\ntransfercustodialwallet\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ndescription the blockchain to work with\ntype
