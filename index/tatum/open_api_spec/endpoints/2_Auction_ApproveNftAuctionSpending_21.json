the nft auction/marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset nft or multi token that is listed for sellingthe auction/marketplace smart contract will transfer the asset to the buyer after the asset is purchased\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nharmony\nklaytn\npolygon\n\nsigning a transaction\nwhen allowing the nft auction/marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nrequestbody\noneof\napprovenftspending\ntype
