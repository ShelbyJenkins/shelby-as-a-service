before operation seller must approve spending of the nft token for the auction contract using approve nft\nafter auction is created auction contract transfers the asset to the auction smart contract\nonly auction for existing nfts can be created  seller must be owner of the nft asset\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nharmony\nklaytn\npolygon\n\na known issue on harmony\non harmony when you are viewing a transaction in the harmony blockchain explorer the transaction status may be displayed as the following\nerror revertedx0\nthis is a known issue with the harmony blockchain explorer this status does not mean that the transaction failed you can safely ignore it\nsigning a transaction\nwhen selling an asset at the nft auction you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nrequestbody\noneof\ncreateauction\ntype
