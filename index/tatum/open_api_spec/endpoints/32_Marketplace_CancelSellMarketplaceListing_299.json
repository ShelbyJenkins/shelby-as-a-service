call\ncancel the selling of an asset on the nft marketplace\nyou can cancel the selling only if you are the seller of the asset or the marketplace operator once the selling is canceled the asset is returned to the seller\nyou cannot cancel the selling if the asset has already been purchased\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nharmony\nklaytn\npolygon\nsolana in alpha\n\nthe execution reverted message\nwhen making this api call you may get the following message\nalthough one or more error occurred execution reverted contract execution completed\nthis message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing the api call you can safely ignore it\nsigning a transaction\nwhen cancelling the selling of an asset you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript
