for an asset on the nft marketplace the listing can be offered for the native blockchain assets for example eth matic and so on or for any fungible tokens\nafter the listing is created allow the marketplace smart contract to transfer the asset that you are selling\nyou can create a listing only for an existing asset that you own you must be the owner of the asset\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nharmony\nklaytn\npolygon\nsolana in alpha\n\na known issue on harmony\non harmony when you are viewing a transaction in the harmony blockchain explorer the transaction status may be displayed as the following\nerror revertedx0\nthis is a known issue with the harmony blockchain explorer this status does not mean that the transaction failed you can safely ignore it\nthe execution reverted message\nwhen making this api call you may get the following message\nalthough one or more error occurred execution reverted contract execution completed\nthis message is a result of the marketplace version check and has no impact on completing the api call you can safely ignore it\nsigning a transaction\nwhen creating a new listing on the nft marketplace you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nrequestbody\noneof\nsellassetonmarketplace\ntype
