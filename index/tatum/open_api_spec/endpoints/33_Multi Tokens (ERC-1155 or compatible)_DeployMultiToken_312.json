deploying a multi token smart contract you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nrequestbody\noneof\ndeploymultitoken\ntype

    "tag_summary": "a multi token combines characteristics of fungible and nonfungible tokens a single multi token smart contract allows you to mint fungible nonfungible and semifungible tokens and process different types of the tokens in a single transaction multi tokens are described by the erc1155 standard on the ethereum blockchain or by the equivalent standard on the other blockchains\nmulti tokens can be used for nearly any digital asset or good to ensure authenticity and scarcity for example\n\ningame assets multi tokens can be used to create unique collectibles in the form of characters weapons skins or other equipment players can resell or trade assets directly as they choose and their authenticity is easily verifiable\nmusic and other digital media multi tokens can be used to create rare and unique collectible digital releases similarly multi tokens can be used to sell videos art or any other type of digital media collectors can own digital originals of their favorite songs movies and so on\ndigital sports merchandise trading cards memorabilia classic moments in sports history and oneofakind experiences can be sold as multi tokens\n\neach multi tokenrelated api supports its own set of the blockchains the list of the supported blockchains is provided in the api description further in this section",
