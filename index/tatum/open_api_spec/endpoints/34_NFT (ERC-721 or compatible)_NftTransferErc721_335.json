flow\n2 credits per api call on the other blockchains\ntransfer an nft from the smart contract the contractaddress parameter in the request body to the specified blockchain address the to parameter in the request body\nin one api call you can transfer only one nft\nthis api is supported for the following blockchains\n\nalgorand\nbnb smart chain\ncelo\nethereum\nflow\nharmony\nklaytn\nkucoin community chain\npolygon\nsolana\ntron\n\nfor ethereum celo and bnb smart chain transferring nfts invokes the safetransfer method\ntransferring nfts on algorand\n\non algorand the recipient has to agree in advance to receive your nft because algorand charges users for storing nfts on their addresses and an algorand blockchain address by default does not receive nfts unless explicitly agreed before transferring an nft make sure that the recipient has agreed to receive the nft to their address\nif you want to transfer an nft that was minted using nft express use the transfernftalgoexpress schema of the request bodynote on the mainnet tatum covers your transaction fees for the nft transfer and pays for them from its own blockchain address then the fee amount paid by tatum is converted to the number of credits and these credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance of your paid pricing plan on the testnet no credits are deducted from the monthly credit allowance\n\ntransferring nfts on solana\nif you want to transfer an nft that was minted using nft express use the transfernftsolana or transfernftsolanakms schema of the request body in the request body\n\nset the from parameter to the address that you used in the to parameter in the request body of the minting call\nset the to parameter to the recipients address\nset the contractaddress parameter to the address from the nftaddress parameter returned in the response body of the minting call\nset the fromprivatekey/signatureid parameter to the private key/signature id of the blockchain address that you specified in the from parameter\n\nsigning a transaction\nwhen transferring an nft you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use the tatum javascript client\nnote this does not apply to transferring nfts that were minted on algorand using nft express see earlier in this section\nrequestbody\noneof\ntransfernft\ntype object\nproperties\nchain\ntype
