blockchain\n  btc ltc doge bch\n  \n    when withdrawal from tatum is executed all deposits which are not processed yet are used as an input and\n    change is moved to pool address 0 of wallet for defined accounts xpub if there are no unspent deposits only last pool address 0 utxo is used\n    if balance of wallet is not sufficient it is impossible to perform withdrawal from this account  funds were transferred to another\n    linked wallet within system or outside of tatum visibility\n    for the first time of withdrawal from wallet there must be some deposit made and funds are obtained from that since\n    there is no withdrawal there was no transfer to pool address 0 and thus it is not present in vin pool transfer is identified by missing dataaddress property in response\n    when last not cancelled withdrawal is not completed and thus there is no tx id of output transaction given\n    we cannot perform next withdrawal\n  \n  eth\n  \n    withdrawal from tatum can be processed only from 1 account in ethereum blockchain each address is recognized as an account and only funds from that account can be sent in 1 transaction\n    example account a has 05 eth account b has 03 eth account a is linked to tatum account 1 account b is linked to tatum account 2 tatum account 1 has balance 07 ethereum and\n    tatum account 2 has 01 eth withdrawal from tatum account 1 can be at most 05 eth even though balance in tatum private ledger is 07 eth\n    because of this ethereum blockchain limitation withdrawal request should always contain sourceaddress from which withdrawal will be made to get available balances for ethereum wallet accounts use hint endpoint\n  \n  xrp\n  \n    xrp withdrawal can contain destinationtag except of address which is placed in attr parameter of withdrawal request\nsourcetag of the blockchain transaction should be withdrawal id for autocomplete purposes of withdrawals\n  \n  xlm\n  \n    xlm withdrawal can contain memo except of address which is placed in attr parameter of withdrawal request xlm blockchain does not have possibility to enter source account information\n    it is possible to create memo in format destinationsource which is supported way of memo in tatum and also there is information about the sender account in the blockchain\n  \n\nwhen withdrawal is created all other withdrawals with the same currency are pending unless the current one is marked as complete or cancelled\ntatum ledger transaction is created for every withdrawal request with operation type withdrawal the value of the transaction is the withdrawal amount  blockchain fee which should be paid\nin the situation when there is withdrawal for erc20 xlm or xrp based custom assets the fee is not included in the transaction because it is paid in different assets than the withdrawal itself\nrequestbody\nwithdrawal\nproperties\nsenderaccountid\ndescription sender account id\nmaxlength 24\nminlength 24\ntype string\naddress\ndescription
