erc20equivalent algorand tokens from a virtual account even from a virtual account without deposit addresses adssigned to the algorand blockchain\nthe recipient has to agree in advance to receive assets because algorand charges users for storing assets on their addresses and an algorand blockchain address by default does not receive assets unless explicitly agreed before sending any asset from a virtual account to the blockchain make sure that the recipient has agreed to receive the assets to their address\nsending algorand assets creates an internal tatum withdrawal request with an id if everything works as expected the withdrawal request is marked as complete and a transaction id is assigned to it\n\nif a server connection is unavailable the withdrawal request is cancelled\nif the transfer to the blockchain is successful but the tatum infrastructure cannot be accesses the id of the blockchain transaction is returned and you have to complete the withdrawal request manually otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending\n\nsigning a transaction\nwhen sending algos or erc20equivalent algorand tokens you are charged a fee for the transaction and you must sign the transaction with the private key of the blockchain address from which the fee will be deducted\nproviding the private key in the api is not a secure way of signing transactions because the private key can be stolen or exposed your private keys should never leave your security perimeter you should use the private keys only for testing a solution you are building on the testnet of a blockchain\nfor signing transactions on the mainnet we strongly recommend that you use the tatum key management system kms and provide the signature id instead of the private key in the api alternatively you can use
