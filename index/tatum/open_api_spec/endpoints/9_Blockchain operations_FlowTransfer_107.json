connected to the transaction costs in subscription credits this operation can be done on mainnet only for paid plans\nsend flow flow or fusd from a virtual account to the blockchain this will create tatum internal withdrawal request with id if every system works as expected withdrawal request is marked as complete and transaction id is assigned to it\n\nif flow server connection is unavailable withdrawal request is cancelled\nif blockchain transfer is successful but is it not possible to reach tatum transaction id of blockchain transaction is returned and withdrawal request must be completed manually otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending\n\nthere are two possibilites how the transaction on the blockchain can be created\n\nusing mnemonic and index  private key is generated based on the index in the mnemonic\nusing secret  private keys is entered manually\n\nit is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without blockchain address assigned to them\nthis method is a helper method which internally wraps these steps\n\nstore withdrawal  create a ledger transaction which debits the assets on the sender account\nperform blockchain transaction\ncomplete withdrawal  move the withdrawal to the completed state when all of the previous steps were successful\n\nthis operation needs the private key of the blockchain address every time the funds are transferred the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key\nno one should ever send its own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds in this method it is possible to enter privatekey\nor signatureid privatekey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds in production\ntatum kms should be used for the highest security standards and signatureid should be present in the request\nalternatively using the tatum client
