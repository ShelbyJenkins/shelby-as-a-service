register a new erc20 or erc20equivalent token in the virtual account\ndescription 2 credits per api call\nthis is the first step to create a new erc20 or erc20 equivalent token with some supply in a virtual account\n\n\nthis method only creates tatum private ledger virtual currency with predefined parameters it will not generate any blockchain smart contract\nthe whole supply of token is stored in the customers newly created account then it is possible to create new tatum accounts with token name as accounts currency\nnewly created account is frozen until the specific smart contract address is linked with the tatum virtual currency representing the token\norder of the steps to create smart contract with tatum private ledger support\n\nregister token this api  creates a virtual currency within tatum\ndeploy smart contract  create new smart contract on the blockchain\nstore smart contract address  link newly created smart contract address with tatum virtual currency  this operation enables frozen account and enables ledger synchronization for tatum accounts\n\nblockchain address will be assigned to the virtual account as a deposit address it can be defined via the address
